# Project Express API


Choosing a dataset: I used Kaggle to find my dataset (airport codes) and then CVSJson.com to convert the csv file to json. It was a large file so I used excel first to delete all airports WITHOUT a IATA code. this gave me a json file with an array of just under 10,000 objects.
